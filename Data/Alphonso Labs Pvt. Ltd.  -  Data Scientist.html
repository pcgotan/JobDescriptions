            <td> Description : </td>
            <td> <p>Alphonso is on a mission to make TV an even better advertising medium for brands, agencies and networks. Today, we are the fastest-growing TV data company with the industry’s largest TV data set. Since 2013, we have been creating new ways for brands and agencies to reach targeted TV audiences across all digital devices. Our best-in-class TV ad analytics enables brands to see the offline impact of their campaigns.</p>

<p>We are looking for smart minds energized to tackle some of the very complex challenges to push the envelope on scale and efficiency. We look for people with strong technical and analytical aptitude; people who have the ability to thrive in a fast-paced, high-volume, and deadline-driven environment. We work hard, innovate every day, and have a ton of fun doing it.</p>

<p><strong>Job Location</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Bangalore, India</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Mountain View, CA, USA</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>New York, NY, USA</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In Alphonso <u><strong>all positions are global</strong></u>. What that means is that the team members (including new hires) are eligible (no special requirements) to relocate to any of the overseas Alphonso offices. The title and responsibilities remain the same independent of the location. The salary and other benefits are adjusted based on economic parameters specific to the location.</p>

<p>The initial posting for all campus hires will be in Bangalore, India. For those who desire to work from an overseas location, will be able to apply for the relevant work permits and VISA. The relocation will be contingent to getting the needed approvals from the foreign government body.</p>

<p><strong>What do Data Scientists at Alphonso do?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Develop scalable data models, machine learning algorithms to facilitate data-driven decision making</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Take advantage of massive amounts of structured data to understand end user behavior and help our advertising customers get better bang for the buck</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Design and evaluate data churning experiments</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use AI/deep learning techniques in conjunction with our ACR technology to extract deep insights</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Be thought leaders and go-to experts on everything related to data</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A few questions we are currently trying to answer:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>TV advertisement analysis:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Brands who advertise on TV want to know the effectiveness of their advertisement campaign. Did it lead to increase in sales/foot traffic/web traffic? How do we measure the effect appropriately? Can we deploy inferential statistics? How do we create test and control groups? Are there other ways to determine the effect better?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Brands also want to know how to better optimize their ad spend. For example, do they perform better in one network vs another? Are particular demographic or geographical areas more receptive than others?</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>TV advertisement indexing and automatic metadata tagging:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>As a TV analytics and measurement company, detection of ads in a video (TV) stream precisely, is of paramount importance to us. How do we use different modalities of a TV stream like video / audio / caption and leverage new advancements in NLP, Computer Vision etc. to automatically discover new ad contents?</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Once new ads are discovered, they need to be tagged with appropriate metadata information like brand name, product name etc. How do we extract important meta information from the available modalities using deep learning and statistical techniques?</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Recommendations:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>TV viewers always prefer timely and good recommendations of programs. How can the program viewership collected by our ACR technology be used to make valid recommendations? Can we leverage it to help TV viewers discover new shows? Is it possible to automatically identify trending events in real time? How do we use linear TV viewership to recommend contents in OTT platforms (like Netflix)? What would be a good method to validate the provided recommendations?</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What are the minimal requirements to join the Data Science team at Alphonso?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Experience applying machine learning algorithms, statistical modeling and time series techniques to real world problems</p>
	</li>
